# Casino clients
 - We collected information using diferent sampling methods
 - Proposed a series of questions to be answered 
 - Analyzed the data to find behavior patterns 
 - Did hypothesis testing for a set of questions

Example 1:
A graph to compare the expected result (win, lose, even) vs the satisfaction a client communicates

Example 2:
A graph to compare attendance density and the satisfaction

And then the hypothesis testing

And therefore we conclude that the attendace rate could be related to the expected satisfaction
