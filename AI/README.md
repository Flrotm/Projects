# AI Projects

# [1: Non linear regression and regularization](https://github.com/Flrotm/Projects/edit/master/AI/py1) 
- Implemented a non-linear regression model
- Implemented regularization techniques (Ridge & Lasso)
- Implemented loss functions
- Implemented gradient descent optimizations (Momentum, adagrad, adadelta & adam)

# [2: Face emotion classification](https://github.com/Flrotm/Projects/edit/master/AI/py2) 
- Reduced data dimentionality by calculating feature vectors using PyWavelets
- Used sklearn to test different models(knn, svm, decision tree)
- Estimated the errors comparing k-fold and bootstrap validation
- Calculated the loss variances 

# [3: Clustering brain images and genes](https://github.com/Flrotm/Projects/edit/master/AI/py3)
- Implemented clustering algorithms (Gaussian Mixture Model, K-means, DBSCAN & Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering)
- Reduced the diemnsionality of the data using PCA in the gene tissue case

In this graph we can see how are 2 clusters represented afer the PCA

# [4: Multilayer perceptron implementation (C++)](https://github.com/Flrotm/Projects/edit/master/AI/py4)
- Implemented a multilayer perception for tumor classification
- Implemented loss and activation functions
- Implemented backpropagation algorithm based on (Sathyanarayana, S. A gentle introduction to backpropagation. (2014))
# [5: Face classification using CNNs](https://github.com/Flrotm/Projects/edit/master/AI/py5)
- Built a custom dataloader for the face dataset
- Tested different models and used transfer learning models for age, sex and expression
- Implemented custom training and testing functions

# [6: Autoencoders for noise reduction](https://github.com/Flrotm/Projects/edit/master/AI/py6)
- Implemented an encoder and a decoder for noise reduction in text images
- Implemented K-fold cross validation for better accuracy
- Implemented mlp and cnn autoencoders with pytorch
These are the results of the CNN autoencoder after reducing the image to a vector of size 10
