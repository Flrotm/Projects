# [1: Non linear regression and regularization](https://github.com/Flrotm/Projects/edit/master/AI/py1) 
- Implemented a non-linear regression model
- Implemented regularization techniques (Ridge & Lasso)
- Implemented loss functions
- Implemented gradient descent optimizations (Momentum, adagrad, adadelta & adam)

# [2: Face emotion classification](https://github.com/Flrotm/Projects/edit/master/AI/py2) 
- Reduced data dimentionality by calculating feature vectors using PyWavelets
- Used sklearn to test different models(knn, svm, decision tree)
- Estimated the errors comparing k-fold and bootstrap validation
- Calculated the loss variances
